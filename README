BravoJS is an implementation of an unratified proposed draft for CommonJS 
Modules/2.0

The current draft this code is based on is located at 
https://bitbucket.org/wesgarland/bravojs/downloads/commonjs%20modules%202.0-8.pdf
and has been included in the references directory.

Caveat User: BravoJS is based on an early draft of an unratified CommonJS 
specification. This means that using this product as it stands today will 
most likely lead you to writing modules which are not compatible with any 
other CommonJS platform.

We have included a shim in the utility folder which provides some compatibility
between CommonJS Modules/2.0 and node.js.
